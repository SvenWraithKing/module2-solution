    <h2>Pudge</h2>
  <p>
    Each carefully aimed throw of Pudge's signature Meat Hook strikes fear into his foes.
    Disoriented, his foe stumbles, gagging on a sudden stench of Rot. 
    As it looks up at the fleshy hulk, hoping for an answer, only to watch as the Butcher Dismembers and carves them with his cleavers, adding a layer to his compost Heap.
    With every kill he gains additional health and damage, and soon becomes an unstoppable behemoth of rotting flesh.A competent wizard knows perhaps two spells; an exceptional one, three or four. 
       Wielding the elements of Quas, Wex and Exort, the Invoker surpasses them all. 
     Forging Spirits of ice and fire to melt away the armor of enemies with great Alacrity while Snapping their heat-deprived cold bodies. 
     Conjuring an Ice Wall to stop foes in their paths before vanishing into thin air, chilling nearby enemies like a Ghost Wandering through their ranks.

       <h2>Wraith king</h2>
       <p>
        On the millennial solstice known as Wraith-Night, Ostarion stood frozen amid the carnage, absorbing innumerable souls as his champions sacrificed their lives for the King.
        Now brimming with Wraith Essence, Ostarion immobilizes his adversaries with Wraithfire Blast, stunning and searing them over time.
        His great-sword smashes foes in one Mortal Strike, sapping their essence to feed his Vampiric Spirit. Only fools trust the erratic reports of Ostarion's death.
